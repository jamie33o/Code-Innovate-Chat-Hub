"""
Routing configuration for WebSocket consumers in the ci_chathub project.

This module defines the WebSocket URL patterns for connecting to
different consumers, such as `PostConsumer` for handling channel posts
and `CommentConsumer` for handling post comments and MessageConsumer for handling messages.

WebSocket URL Patterns:
- ws/channel_posts/(?P<channel_id>\d+)/$: Connects to `PostConsumer` for channel posts.
- ws/post_comments/(?P<post_id>\d+)/$: Connects to `CommentConsumer` for post comments.
