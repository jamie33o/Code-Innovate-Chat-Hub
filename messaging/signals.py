Signals module for the messaging app.

This module contains Django signals that are used to perform certain actions
in response to specific events in the messaging app. Currently, it includes a
signal receiver for the post-save event of the Message model, which creates
an UnreadMessage instance when a new message is created.

    Signal receiver to create an UnreadMessage instance when a new Message is created.

    This function is a post-save signal receiver that is triggered when a new Message

    receiver of the message.

    Parameters:
    - sender: The model class that sends the signal (Message in this case).
    - instance: The actual instance being saved (the new Message instance).
    - created (bool): A boolean indicating whether the instance was created.
    - kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.
